### Why Dev Angel?
Developer engagement and retention on any protocol depends on the turn around times of the devRel / developer advocates. The volumes of chat activity generated on Discord and other social platforms add to the noise and makes it hard for devRels to resolve issues raised by developers in time. Result: Developers lose interest and leave the protocol.

Dev Angel reduces the turn around time for devRels by
- tracking unanswered questions with urgency levels based on days of inactivity
- tagging developers as per new, experienced, mentor categories, so that their questions are highlighted with importance accordingly
- peer code /debug over video call
- email notifications (daily/hourly/per developer) for open issues

Additionally Dev Angel creates Proof-of-Mentorship to show devRel activity.
